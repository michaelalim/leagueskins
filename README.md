# leagueskins
made a webpage featuring league of legends. I have used a search bar which I have recently learned and will do a modal wherein it will show off the champions' different skins.

## update as of oct 22, 2021
- still a webpage the features league of legends (game)
- Search bar is done. A little bit of tweaks here and there for champions like **Wukong** wherein its name on Riot Games's Data, hence also its name on the used API, is MonkeyKing.
  - this has caused him not to show when we search Wukong on the search-bar. He will show up instead when we type in Monkey King which not a lot recognizes him by that name.
- Modal is on-going. Info page incomplete. Responsiveness is going well.
  - about the info modal, will add info like when the champion is a fighter, a mage, etc.
  - will also add a range showing their affinity when it comes to attack, defense, magic --- and also difficulty
- skins and skills modal coming soon.
