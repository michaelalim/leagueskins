# leagueskins
made a webpage featuring league of legends. I have used a search bar which I have recently learned and will do a modal wherein it will show off the champions' different skins.

- Used an API Link: https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol?fbclid=IwAR3D22UnmVfDdZVB-3HrZrl-ty3NlLFU6b_Q_lm3j8TrZz1X2XDR-T-k2xE#data-dragon_champion-splash-art
  - this is also found in the script.js file
- The characters used in the project, their images, lores, and data like character's damages and stuff are all owned by Riot Games Company, specifically from their game called League of Legends.

## update as of oct 22, 2021
- still a webpage the features league of legends (game)
- Search bar is done. A little bit of tweaks here and there for champions like **Wukong** wherein its name on Riot Games's Data, hence also its name on the used API, is MonkeyKing.
  - this has caused him not to show when we search Wukong on the search-bar. He will show up instead when we type in Monkey King which not a lot recognizes him by that name.
- Modal is on-going. Info page incomplete. Responsiveness is going well.
  - about the info modal, will add info like when the champion is a fighter, a mage, etc.
  - will also add a range showing their affinity when it comes to attack, defense, magic --- and also difficulty
- skins and skills modal coming soon.
